# Unplugged Jewelry App

This project will deliver a complete package of a cross-platform app for both Android/iOS smartphones which interfaces with Jewelry devices.

App Features
The app will allow owners of Unplugged jewelry devices to pair them with their smartphones for enabling notification feedback.

Notifications will be sent out as a vibration feedback to the userâ€™s paired jewelry when key people are trying to reach them.

Users may choose who among their contacts are the key people in their life, for whom the jewelry will respond to their notifications. Contacts may be imported from Apple, WhatsApp, Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn and Phone contact lists. 

Project Timeline
Here is the proposed timeline for the project which includes estimates and payment schedules for each milestone that is accomplished. The project will follow the Agile software development process for a realistic execution and delivery of tasks. The project will be finished within 4-6 months.

Please note that all the items and estimates below are not final and are subject to change depending on requirements or feature changes/updates and availability of assets or third-party services.

During the development, we may require you to provide feedback on current iterations of the app for enhancements or recommendations.
